So, these may not be actually useful afterall:

It occurs to me that instead of managing a suite of apps that talk to
services, the better solution would be to use AWS Lambda.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-introduction.html

This requires using node.js & kinesis (@ $0.015/hr ~ $.36 day)
http://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/pricing/

ea lamba would contain keys out
    ea incoming record contains token and minimal info in.

limits
* kinesis records limited to 50K max (50K can contain smaller records)
** use s3 for data? Poll from bridge lambda worker?
    http://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/
* How communicate status back? Is that even needed?
