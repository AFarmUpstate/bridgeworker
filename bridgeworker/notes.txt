So, these may not be actually useful afterall:

It occurs to me that instead of managing a suite of apps that talk to
services, the better solution would be to use AWS Lambda.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-introduction.html

This requires using node.js and an event generator (most AWS funcs qualify)

ea lamba would contain keys out
    ea incoming record contains token and minimal info in.

limits
* lambda funcs are auto killed @ 60s (how will this impact iOS feed?)
* monitor dynamodb table for inserts.
** can we collect into batches?

should we just route through sns? http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/mobile-push-send-custommessage.html
